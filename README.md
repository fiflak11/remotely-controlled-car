# Remotely Controlled Car Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a remotely controlled car using Arduino and the nRF24L01 wireless communication module. The car can be operated via a remote control, allowing for basic movements such as forward, backward, and turning.

## Components Used
- 2 x Arduino Board
- 2 x nRF24L01+ Wireless Module
- 2 x DC Motors (wheels)
- L293D (H-Bridge)
- Push Buttons
- Power Supply for Arduinos
- Power Supply for wheels (i used series battery holder and 4 x battery AA 1,5V)

## Circuits Diagrams
I will add in near future
